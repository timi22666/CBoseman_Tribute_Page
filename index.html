        <p>Chadwick Aaron Boseman was an American Actor, best known for is role as Black Panther. He was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina, the son of Carolyn Mattress and Leroy Boseman, both African-American. His mother was a nurse, and his father worked at a textile factory and managed an upholstery business. In his youth, Boseman practiced martial arts, and continued this training as an adult. As a child, he wanted to become an architect. According to Boseman, DNA testing indicated that some of his ancestors were Krio people and Limba people from Sierra Leone, and Yoruba people from Nigeria.He graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995. In his junior year, he wrote his first play, Crossroads, and staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and killed</p>

        <p>Chadwick attended Howard University in Washington, D.C. and graduated in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in directing. While at college he worked in a black bookstore near the university, which friend Vanessa German said was important and inspirational to him; he drew on his experience there for his play <em>Hieroglyphic Graffiti</em>.</p>
        
        <p>One of his instructors at Howard was Phylicia Rashad, who became one of his mentors, and also contacted some of her friends (including the largest contributor, Denzel Washington, who also became Boseman's friend) and other faculty members, who contributed to a travel and tuition fund which allowed Boseman and a few of his classmates to attend the British American Drama Academy's Midsummer at Oxford Program at Oxford University, Oxford, England, UK.</p>

        <p>In 2008, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Boseman began dating singer Taylor Simone Ledward in 2015. The two reportedly got engaged by October 2019. Boseman was raised a Christian and also was part of a church choir and youth group. </p>
        <p>Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which eventually progressed to stage IV before 2020. He had never spoken publicly about his cancer diagnosis. During treatment, involving multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, he continued to work and completed production for several films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, and others. Boseman died at his home as a result of complications related to colon cancer on August 28, 2020, with his wife and family by his side. </p>

    <h3>PERSONAL QUOTES</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
          <div class="qoutes"><li><q>I started out as a writer and a director. I started acting because I wanted to know how to relate to the actors. When people ask me what I do, I don't really say that I'm an actor, because actors often wait for someone to give them a role.</q></li> </div>
          
          <div class="qoutes"><li><q>You have to cherish things in a different way when you know the clock is ticking, you are under pressure.</q></li></div>
          
          <div class="qoutes"><li><q>When you're doing a character, you want to know the full landscape. You want to know them spiritually, mentally and physically.</q></li></div>
          
          <div class="qoutes"><li><q>As an African-American actor, a lot of our stories haven't been told.</q></li></div>
          
          <div class="qoutes"><li><q> [on Black Panther (2018)] You might say that this African nation is fantasy. But to have the opportunity to pull from real ideas, real places and real African concepts, and put it inside of this idea of Wakanda - that's a great opportunity to develop what a sense of identity is, especially when you're disconnected from it.</q></li> </div>
          
          <div class="qoutes"><li><q>When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, 'I used everything You gave me'.</q></li></div>
